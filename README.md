# Feature Engineering and Size Impact Analysis Read.me

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing the impact of features and size on house prices. The analysis is conducted using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Task

The objective of this analysis is to further investigate the relationship between various features and the prices of houses. Specifically, we aim to explore how key features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and square footage influence house prices. By conducting this analysis, we seek to identify how these features collectively contribute to the valuation of properties.

## Python Library

The analysis is implemented using the following Python libraries:

- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For creating visualizations to explore relationships between variables.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization to gain insights into the data.

## Explanation

To conduct the analysis, the following steps are taken:

1. **Data Loading**: The dataset containing information about houses, including features such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and prices, is loaded into the analysis environment.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Through EDA techniques, we explore the relationships between key features and house prices. Visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots are utilized to understand the distribution of variables and identify potential correlations.

3. **Feature Engineering**: Feature engineering techniques may be applied to create new features or transform existing ones to better capture the relationships with house prices. This could include creating interaction terms, scaling features, or encoding categorical variables.

4. **Size Impact Analysis**: Specifically, we focus on analyzing the impact of size-related features (e.g., square footage) on house prices. This involves examining how variations in size influence property valuations and whether these effects are consistent across different types of properties.

5. **Feature Importance**: We assess the importance of each feature in predicting house prices. This may involve techniques such as feature importance scores from machine learning models or statistical analysis to determine the relative contribution of each feature to the overall valuation.
